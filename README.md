Hearst API Website

Starter Kit aimed at setting the baseline styles for the Hearst API Portal.

Built off of Bootstrap 3.0 with HTML5 Boilerplate, layout is mobile first with responsive media queries.  

All styling contained in /css/bootstrap-theme.css 

A styleguide is being developed in conjunction with the rest of the styles at, styleguide.html within the root folder.
